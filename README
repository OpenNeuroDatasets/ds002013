Visual Receptive Field Mapping Experiment
=========================================

This BIDS data set encompasses the data underlying the analyses reported in Heinzle et al. (2011) and Soch et al. (2019).

Alongside with the files required by the BIDS format, this data set contains the following additional files:

- /sub-X/data2BIDS_X.mat: SPM jobs used for converting raw data to the BIDS format;

- /sub-X/preproc_X.mat: an SPM job for pre-processing the data according to Soch et al. (2019);

- /sub-X/anat/sub-X_roi-Z.nii: region of interest (ROI) images for visual cortices in pre-processed EPI space;

- /sub-X/func/sub-X_task-Y_events.mat: all experimental design information in SPM format ("names, onsets, durations");

- /sub-X/func/sub-X_task-Y_events.xls: all experimental design information in Excel format (trials of interest vs. control fixation task).
